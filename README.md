# llm-nl2sql-civil-eng
LLM-based NL2SQL assistant for querying civil engineering project management databases.

## Overview
This repository documents my internship project on **agentic LLM applications for NL2SQL translation**.  
The system was designed in a 3-member team at **Glodon Digital R&D Center**, focusing on enabling natural language queries over large-scale civil engineering project databases.

Key ideas explored in this project:
- **Agentic LLM orchestration** for robust query generation.
- **RAG pipeline with FAISS** to reduce hallucinations by ~30%.
- **Benchmarking 500+ queries**, achieving **92% execution accuracy** on 10k+ project records with **25% higher success rate** than baseline.

⚠️ **Note:** Due to company copyright and data confidentiality, the original code and databases cannot be directly uploaded here.  
This repository is under **active maintenance** – public demo code, synthetic datasets, and simplified implementations will be gradually added.
